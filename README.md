# Programming-Assignment-1
This repository contains the solutions for the given problems in Programming Assignment#1. The assignment focuses on the basic functions and codes to which it is applied on this assessment.
Three distinct problems were solved in this file: Alphabetical Sorting - a function that sorts words alphabetically, Words to Emotion Conversion - replaces a given sentence that includes specific words which will turn into an emoticon, and Unpacking List - unpacks given variables and list them into first, middle, and last.


# Alphabetical Sorting

For this problem, the students were tasked to create the python code relating to alphabetical sorting

On the variable line, this is where the user will be asked to put anything (Sentences, words, Letters)

On the sorting variable, this is the process where the given example will be sorted alphabetically (From a to z and capital letters sorted)

The print will then show the sorted alphabet after the process from sorting and user input


# Word To Emotion

For this problem, the students were tasked to create the python code relating to Word To Emoticon

On the function line or "def", it defines the "emote" and will replace the specific words assigned

Created a dictionary using the the assigned "emote" variable and it's content to it's corresponding emoticon ( :), :(, :D, >:( )

In the return section, it splits the sentences into individual words, lowers each word to lower-case, dictionary checking (checks if the specific word is given. If given = emoticon), and reassembles them into single string spaces

The print will then show the sentence but changes the specific word (if inputted by the user) into the emoticon


# Unpacking List

For this problem, the students were tasked to create the python code relating to Unpacking List

On the variable line or "variable", a list was created from 1 to 6

The first variable was assigned to 0 or the value of 1. It stores it on the "First" variable

The middle variable was assigned to 1:-1 or it gets the first and last value. It stores it on the "Middle" variable

The last variable was assigned to -1 or the value of 6. It stores it on the "Last" variable

The print will then show the listed values for "First", "Middle", and "Last" variables with their labels
